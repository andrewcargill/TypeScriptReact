# Izzi's Show Jumping Timer

As a family we are very active within the sport of show jumping. My daughters compete in club, regional and national competitions.

At the club level competitions are timed with paper and a smart phone - while at regional and national level an online app is used to officiate over times and ranking.

I saw a gap in the market for an app that could be used at club level and for training. 

Alongside this - many young riders enjoy 'hobby horse' jumping - and so this app also had this user in mind.

## Programming languages and approach

I primarily made this app to learn TypeScript. I did not want the project to become too complex so I chose to manage all data within the frontend and used ReactJS as my main framework.

### `TypeScript`

As a new programmer I am always wanting to expand on my current skill base while also broadening on what I know. I had not word with TypeScript before and so was interested to learn on the pros and cons of incorporating it into a React frontend. 

Now that the basic app is built I can reflect in saying that I have really enjoyed TypeScript. I discovered that TypeScript really helps to highlight coding errors before testing and this saved alot of time in bug-finding and code fixing.


### `React Global API`
Previous projects have either required a stand-alone frontend or custom API's with  linked frontends.

This application did not require an API. The data did not need to be stored for later recall or use.  

At the time of writing I feel very comfortable developing within React and the way that useState handles the update of variables etc.

I was needing to manage states globally, rather than pass states between sibblings, as I wanted unrelated components to be able to access various states. I found Gloabl API to be a game-changer in developing this app and something I really am glad to have discovered and learnt more about.

### `Material UI`

This project makes use of Material UI for basic styling. I have used MUI in previous projects and find it leads to quick styling and creation of UI's. 

The limitations are when you need to custom style beyond the basics of color and size, but as this project was more focused on learning TypeScript I feel it was a good choice. 



## Future Developments
### `UX Design`
The app is basically styled - enough so that it is clear to use and interact with. I would like to spend more time styling the app for a specific target audience. Riding is a sport for 4 year olds to 80 year olds - so obviously this would be styled very differently depending on the target age range. More market research would be needed to identify the largest demographic.  


### `React Native`
The development of smartphone apps is something I would like to explore. Currently the project is geared around my learning and so more development would be needed on the app if I were to choose to release it for smartphones.
